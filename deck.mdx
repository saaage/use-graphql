# <em>What are Hooks?</em>
ðŸŽ£

---

# Hooks are functions 
<ul>
  <li><span style={{ color: 'silver' }}>const [myState, setMyState]</span> = <b style={{ color: 'blue' }}>useState</b>(<span style={{ color: 'silver' }}>true</span>) </li>
  <li><b style={{ color: 'blue' }}>useEffect</b>(<span style={{ color: 'silver' }}>() => fetchSomeData()</span>) </li>
</ul>

<Notes>Released by the React team in version 16.8, hooks provide components the ability to use state and other core React features without the need to write classes. <br /> motivate...</Notes>

# Why hooks?
<ul>
  <li>Remove confusing class components</li>
  <li>Provide a better primitive for sharing stateful logic between components</li>
</ul>

<Notes>Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.</Notes>

---

<HOC />

<Notes>HOCs are functions that take components as arguments and return a new, enhanced component. Popular libraries
supporting this pattern include Recompose (now deprecated with the release of hooks), as well as Apollo which we will go into more depth on.</Notes>

---

<RenderProps />

<Notes>A render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render.</Notes>

---

<Split>
<Image src="./assets/wraphell.png" size="auto" />

<h2 style={{ marginTop: 512 }}>ðŸ”¥ Wrapper Hell</h2>
</Split>

<Notes>Opening React Dev-Tools to inspect your component now reveals something similar to this. Top level components
that wrap other components endlessly before rendering your component.</Notes>

# How can hooks help solve these problems?

# Additional notes on hooks

<ul>
  <li>Should be called unconditionally</li>
  <li>Should be prefixed with <b style={{ fontFamily: 'Dank Mono', color: 'purple' }}>use</b></li> 
  <li>Future optimizations on roadmap by the React team</li>
</ul>
